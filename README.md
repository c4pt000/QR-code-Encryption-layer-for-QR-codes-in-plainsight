# the QR code has to have a small region visible of pin dots within the rest of the pin dots a QR code inside of a QR code around 25 px by 25 px for a 250 px by 250 px size QR code (guestimate) the smaller QR code has a region that is generated for an OTP or 2FA pin to allow a camera to do the visual detection to allow import from the client side into the device


* for sensitive data QR code import
(this is a fictious QR code just as a visual mental experimental / explaination

# update noticed this news story

https://threatpost.com/qr-codes-cyberattack-usage-spikes/165526/

^^ non protected QR code images without a binding OTP or 2FA pin encoded into the QR as a small grouping of dots (through a QR code generator linked to a 2FA key or OTP key to generate a key to allow a phone or camera client to make the import to the device)

as proposed below a few years ago


# QR-code-Encryption-layer-for-QR-codes-in-plainsight
QR code Encryption layer for QR codes in plainsight

to add a layer to the standard model of QR code engines for the random creation of QR codes to protect the QR code for authorized user application import

a signing key could be implemented as part of the QR pattern as layer of encryption and this same signing key used to generate the QR code could be imported into the application before any QR code is imported from the generating application to further protect QR codes from the misuse of most photographic equipment to protect and prevent the QR code from being imported to external applications outside of the user importing the QR code into said user's application

application authorized QR codes, using a signing key to generate the encryption layer as part of an extended pattern of the already existient QR code pattern generation nested in the QR code 

used to protect sensitive or financial information encoded into a QR code
